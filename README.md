# dayPlanner

dayPlanner works as an application by using Moment.Js and jQuery to give the user a dynamic way to plan their day. It works by allowing using to create their own itineriary for the business day. Each time block from 9am - 5pm has a dynamic way to save the user's tasks for that timeblock. As well as a visual to see if the timeblock has passed or not. The user's input is saved using client side local storage to store tasks for the time blocks. This way if the user refreshes the information is not erased.
